Fabflix is a platform for users searching, browsing and shopping the movies they're interested. This project is bulit on the course CS-122b.

FabFlix is a JAVA web application using AJAX and HTTPS to send requests and fetch data database.

Used both AWS and Google Cloud to set up the web server. 

Used mysql as the database of the application and enabled the full text search funtion to support movie searching functions. 

Imported framingo toolkit to use user defined function in mysql to support fuzzy search.

Implemented some performance tuning to scale the fablix and improve its efficiency by using master/slave mysql replication, apache load balancer and Jmeter.
