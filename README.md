Fabflix is a platform for users searching or browsing the movies they're interested. This project is bulit on the course CS-122b.

It's a JAVA web application and uses AJAX and HTTP to send requests and fetch data database.
Use both AWS and Google Cloud to set up the web server. After testing, application will go smooth and responsive on these two 
cloud server services.

Use mysql as the database of the application and enable the full text search funtion to support movie searching functions. 
In addition, we import framingo toolkit to use user defined function in mysql to support fuzzy search.

At last, we did some performance tuning to scale the fablix and improve its efficiency by using master/slave mysql replication,
apache load balancer and Jmeter.
